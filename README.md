# Power-Bi-AtliQ-Hardware-Business-Insights-360


## ðŸ“‚Project Overview

AtliQ Hardware is a global electronics company specializing in computers, peripherals, and accessories. In recent years, the company has significantly expanded its operations worldwide. With this rapid growth, the complexity of business challenges has also increased.
To tackle these challenges and promote data-driven decision-making, AtliQ Hardware has hired a dedicated Data Analytics team. While the company previously relied on Excel for reporting, the growing scale of operations has made Power BI the preferred tool for advanced data visualization and reporting.
This project aims to provide stakeholders with actionable insights across key business domains such as Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chain. The ultimate goal is to ensure greater data transparency and support strategic decision-making through interactive Power BI dashboards.

The entire project has provided end to end experience. I worked on this project by following the Codebasics PowerBi Course, Link to the course is [here](https://codebasics.io/courses/power-bi-data-analysis-with-end-to-end-project)
